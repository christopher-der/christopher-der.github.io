<h1><b>Fetching Data Using API</b></h1>

<h2><b>Introduction</b></h2>
<p>Hello all I hope you enjoyed last week's blog about user authentication. It was certainly one of my favorite subjects to talk about. For this week, I will going over a few of my prototype designs in both Python and Javascript using API. The whole idea behind these Python and Javascript files is to fetch data from the API given from both RapidAPI and Alpha Vantage. This blog is inspired from my ongoing senior design projects where my team and I are tasked to create a stock-viewing website that is brought up/hosted by a scalable EC2 instance from Amazone Web Services. In this blog, I'll be discussing about my implementations, complications, and thought process behind retrieving and displaying stock data to a basic HTML webpage from a JSON file. Let's begin!</p>

<h2><b>Prototype One</b></h2>

<p>This is the code that began it all. I signed up for an API key from Alpha Vantage and it supplied me with the API key almost immediately. I did some research and looked up so documentation as to how to fetch data from an API using Javascript using Alpha Vantage. However, despite my best efforts, I found documentation about how to fetch this table of data using Python. So my thought process here was to use Python to replace Javascript since there was a lack of documentation to fetch data from the API in regards to Javascript. I studied the data (the data) that was displayed to me and figured that I can fetch data individually from the table and treat it as if it was like a JSON file by utilizing the dates and the first row as reference to search for a specific piece of data.

<h2><b>Prototype Two</b></h2>

<p>I used my first prototype to as a stepping stone to create my second prototype. The second prototype is a major improvement over the first. Instead of outputting, the entire chart as shown in prototype one. I modified the code in which it retrieve the most current data that the user wants. So the entire process goes like this: the program ask which stock the user wants to search and the type of data the user wants to look up. The type of data is strictly limited to open, high. low, close, and volume. The only complications that I had with the second prototype is that it will not retrieve data on the weekends or on holidays because it uses the date given from the python library instead of the data from the metadata given from the JSON file which at the time I didn't know existed. In this code, I had to reformat the date given from the Python library and assign it to a variable in which the API can reference which day it is retrieving the information from.

<h2><b>Prototype Three</b></h2>

<p>There is no significant differences between my third prototype and second prototype except that I added a graph by using one of the external Python libraries to plot the data from the API. I still encounter the same issues regarding the date. Overall, the third prototype had really minor changes compared to the previous so there's no news here.

<h2><b>Prototype Four</b></h2>

<p>On my fourth prototype, I made a few inquiries about using the Alpha Vantage API in a Javascript file and I found out that I can use RapidAPI to get me started. The only complication for me is to figure how to extract data from a JSON file through Javascript since I have never did it before. I looked up some youtube videos and figured out how to extract the data from the API. My problem here is in the youtube video, they reference the object by using a "."; however, when I tried to do that, I got an error because the way the object is reference contains another object and the syntax of the object cannot be referenced by using the ".". I decided to based it off my Python code by using brackets as reference to the object instead of ".". Sure enough, it worked and I was able to pull data from the JSON file. I made the Javascript file dynamic by assigning some variable to reference the metadata to keep pulling the most up to date information. However, as for user input, it is still a work in progress and I should be able to get it to work easily in my next prototype, along with a graph to plot the data from the JSON file. I managed to acquire a script to display a clock in US Eastern since the API is using that timezone. Overall, I believe I made significant improvement in terms of gathering and displaying data by using an API based on my past prototypes. In the end, once I make the search inquiry dynamic and user friendly, I can integrate it with my group's webpage and we will have a full functioning legit site that displays and extracts data properly.</p>
