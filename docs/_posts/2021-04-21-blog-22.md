<h1><b>Linked List Code Part 2</b></h1>

<h2><b>Introduction</b></h2>
<p>Ok we're back with Part two with the code for Linked List. To recap, in last week's blog, we discussed about the creation of the node, linked list, and its function in Python. I explained how to integrate what we learned about linked list into the code as well as why we need to implement the logic from each function and object to have a functional linked list. For this week's blog, I'm going explain to you how the logic works and how to code the insert function, delete function, and display function. In addition, because this code does not require user input, I will also show all of you how to actually run the code. I understand that last week I left all of you in a cliff hanger and only went over two functions which are append and length; however, the next few functions as I stated earlier are going to spicy and I am pretty sure all of you will enjoy the content because I know I will. With that said, let's beging
</p>

<h2><b>The Function</b></h2>

<p>The idea behind the delete function is to delete any node in the linked list, this also includes the head or tail. In this function, we're not going to delete the node that we want to delete. Instead, we're going to redirect the prior node to point to the next node  instead of the node we are "deleting". First, we need to do an error check, meaning that we need to make sure the node we are deleting is within the index of the linked list. If the user inputs an index that falls outside of the range of the index, we would return an error message. This scenario is where the length function comes into play. After the error check, we can begin the actual code. Basically, we are going to traverse through the entire linked list until we reach the element we are trying to delete. We are going to start off at head and create a variable to keep a count of where we are. Using a while loop, we're going to check each node to see if the current element we are on matches the element we are trying to "delete". This is the tricky part. I am going to use two pointers. The currentNode variable is going to be my reference or placeholder pointer while the prevNode variable is going to skip the node we are going to delete and reroute to the next node. This is where we use the .next function comes into play. In line 42, to break it down, we are going to say the next node of where prevNode is will point to the next node of where next node of the currentNode is. There you go, as simple as that, we rerouted the node to skip the node we want to delete and move along to the next node.

<p>The idea behind the add function is to add a node to a linked list. The difference between the add and the append function is that the add function can insert a node at any element in the linked list while the append function can only insert a node at the end of the linked list or at the tail. Same as the delete function, we need to include an error check to make sure the node we are inserting are within the indices of the linked list. As per usual, I am going to use two variables as pointers to reference where I'm at in the linked list and create a variable to keep track at what element of the linked list I am on. We're going to traverse through the linked list until we reach to the element where we want to insert a node. From here, we will create a new node and assign it to prevNode.next, meaning that our next node where our pointer is for prevNode will be the new node we just created. Very quickly, let's not forget we're passing some data to the node the user wants to put. This can be anything. Now, all we need to do is reroute the new node and have it point to the next node which is our currentNode since its pointer is in front of our prevNode's pointer. Therefore, in line 63, we set our newNode.next to be the currentNode.

<p>The idea behind the show function is to display the data of the linked list in a neatly manner. To do this, we will need to create an empty list. From there we would need to traverse through the linked list to append all the data to the empty list. This is where the append function comes into play. To ensure that we're not going out of bounds while traversing through the linked list, we would use a while loop to check if the next node is not null or empty. If it is empty, then we can just print out our list.

<p>In lines 82 to 89, we first need to assign the object to a variable as reference. The list() object is a general object and we must assign it to a variable as refernce to that object, similar to we call each person by their name. From there, we will reference their name with the intended function and pass values into these function. As you can see in the next image, we have the results below. It's as simple as that!
