<h1><b>Linked List Code Part 1</b></h1>

<h2><b>Introduction</b></h2>

<p>Hello all! To recape what I went through last week, linked list are dynamic arrays in which to access the data of the nth index requires us to travese through n - 1 nodes to pull data. This type of data structure essential in the programming world because the amount data given to us can vary. In the last blog, I went over the properties of what makes a linked list a linked list along with the difference between singly and soubly linked list. As promised, for today's blog, I'll be showing and explaining to you the code for creating a linked list. Keep in mind, this would most likely make sense to people who have some sort of knowledge of object orientted programming because the code involves using constructors to give objects their properties. In addition, the code I'll be showing is written in Python; therefore, some knowledge of Python syntax is required. Without further a do, let's begin! </p>

<h2><b>The Objects</b></h2>

<p>First thing first, we need to create the actual object. Creating the functionality of a linked list requires two parts which are the node and the linked list itself. When creating the node object, we need create a __init__ function to initialize the default values of the node's properties. Because we are manually going to input data into these nodes, we are going to declare the data within the nodes as null, meaning they contain no value. Also, since we are making only one node our next iteration of our node indicated by .next will need to be remain null. As a result, you basically construct a single node that you can create when coding the rest of the linked list. The next object we're going over is the list. There are many ways to generate a linked list, but for the purpose of this code, we'll be using self.head as a placeholder instead of a node containg actual header. Using this kind of method will allow us to traverse through the linked list when implmenting functions such as deleting node and inserting nodes.</p>

<h2><b>The Function</b></h2>
<img src ="https://i.gyazo.com/1e90426f07c478abfe41a5b1a51ae420.png">
<p>One of the many functions of a linked list is to append additional data/nodes to the end of the linked list. As you can see here, the function takes in one parameter even though it shows it takes two. The reason why its structure like this is that self refers to the object's name that it is referencing to when calling these functions; therefore, self doesn't really count as a parameter at least passing through the function. As we can see here, we will need to create a new node to append to the data. The idea here is to traverse through the entire linked list until you reach to the tail. Because the tail points to a null value, we can insert the new node to the tail by using the next method to check the required conditions within in the while loop.</p>

<p>This function here will return the value of the linked list's index. This function is not really important and typically is not needed in a linked list. However, The code implemented this function within another function to check for index errors just in case if the user is not familiar with the indices of the linked list. Checking the length of the linked list is a simple task. We're going to start off at our placeholder so we're not counting it. We're going to check the next node (a.k.a the head, in this case) to see if it contains a null value. If the node contains some sort of data, it will traverse to the next node and increment its counter by 1. This process will repeat itself until it reaches to the end and it will then return the total number of nodes or the length of the linked list.

<h2><b>Part 2 Coming Soon</b></h2>

<p>As I was going through the number of screenshots that I have and the number of function, giving a full explanation for the next few functions will turn this blog into a web novel of some sort. Therefore, I decided that it is best to split the Linked List tutorial into two parts. To recap, in today's blog, I went over the basics of creating a constructor for two objects along with two functions which are appending a node to the linked list and retrieving the length of the linked list. For next week's blog, I'll be going over the function on deleting the node, inserting a node, and displaying the entire linked list onto the console. With that said, I hope you all enjoy this blog and I'll see you next week for Linked List Code Part 2
