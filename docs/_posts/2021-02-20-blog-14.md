<h1><b>IDOR Exploitation</b></h1>


<h2><b>Introduction</b></h2>
<p>Hello Everyone! Welcome to another week of tutorials. For this week, I am going to be talking about exploiting Indirect Object Referencing or IDOR, in short. What is IDOR you asked? IDOR is when an application references to an object by its direct name or ID which is used to load a website. From there, hackers can easily exploit and modify the parameters and access restricted areas of the webpage if the application does not authenticate and authorize it. This type of vulnerability can lead to security breaches and leaks within a company. These breaches and leaks can range from low severity, such as data or information that anyone can access, to critical levels of severity, such as company secrets, personal user data. Overall, company will need to patch IDOR vulernabilities within their application/webpage to ensure that the integrity of the company and its data does not fall into the wrong hands. In today's tutorial, I'll be showing you how to exploit IDOR vulnerabilities using a workshop that I recently joined called Codepath. The workshop is design to improve our cybersecurity skills by knowing how these vulnerabilities work and how to prevent them. To start, we will need to download a program called Burpsuite to monitor all incoming and oncoming http traffic. I'll go over Burpsuite in another tutorial to showcase its functionality and purpose. Without further a do, let's get into the exercise and explanation!
</p>


<h2><b>Examples and Explanation</b></h2>

<h3><b>Example 1</b></h3>

<p>As you can see here, a very simple exercise. On the first picture, you want to send that http request to get a response from the server. I clicked on the refresh my profile button and I got a response (see second picture). The response gives me all the information. I located the request/response I sent from Burpsuite and send it to the repeater. From there, I can modify the request and resend the request. Before I do that, the objective here is to obtain a key from the website by accessing the administrator's profile. As we can see here on line 15, we can modify the parameter for the username to admin or administrator to see if that'll give us the appropriate response we need. The reason why I chose admin or administrator is simply because they're commonly use to indicate the administrator. So let's try replacing guest with admin.</p>

<p>Boom! We got the key by replacing the word guest with admin and resending the request. As a result, we got our key as shown in the picture above. Congratulations! You exploited  your first IDOR vulnerability. Let's move on to another example.</p>


<h3><b>Example 2</b></h3>

<p>In this exercise, this is a bit different from what you already learn. Based on the http request, we can see that each user in the list is identified by their unique ID number. Another strategy to exploit the IDOR vulnerability is to compare all request and information you comprise from Burpsuite and see if there is a pattern. As you can see, I have shown you 4 of the 5 entries in the picture above that follows a specific sequence. We can see the following sequence is 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 which we can easily discern the next number in the following sequence even though there are more than 5 users. However, the hint they have given to us is that the key is located within a <strong>HIDDEN</strong> user that is <strong>NOT</strong> on the list. Therefore, let's try the number 11 since we know the given sequence are all odd numbers.</p>

<p>Look what do we have here. A key! As you can see, we saw the pattern and we solved it. As a result, we used our logic to come up with a possible solution to the pattern given to us. Of course in real life, it will not be as easy, but clues, in general, will always hint us to a possible solution</p>

<h3><b>Example 3</b></h3>

<p>This exercise may look similar to the last, but as you can see in the second picture, we have a different user ID. It seems that the user ID has been hashed and encoded using ASCII HEX, but no worry, we can use <a href="https://crackstation.net/">Crackstation</a> to help us find what kind of hash did the website use even tho it is irreverseable. When you copy and paste the checksum into Crackstation, you should have got the number 2 and the hash that the website used was MD5. If we do it for the rest of the entries, we would get the following sequence: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11. This sequence should look familiar and it is because these are all prime numbers. Therefore if we follow the sequence, the next number is 13, but how do we hash and encode it you ask? Well, theres a function in BurpSuite called decoder and it allows us to encode, decode, and/or hash characters. We simply type the number 13 into the decoder and we first hash it using MD5. From there, we need to encode it using ASCII Hex. After all those steps, you should have something like the image I have below.

<p>Simply copy paste the new checksum that I have above into the repeater and send the http request. Just like that, you found your key.The exercise is not as hard as you think it is once you recognize and have an idea of what is going on. My best advice is to try everything that you think that is relevant to looking for the solution. Well that is it for today's tutorial/lesson. I hope all of you learned something about how to exploit IDOR vulnerabilities using a software like or similar to BurpSuite. I'll talk to you all in the next tutorial!</p>
