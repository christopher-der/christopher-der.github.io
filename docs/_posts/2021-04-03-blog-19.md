<h1><b>Simple Python Number Guessing Gaming </b></h1>

<h2><b>Introduction</b></h2>

<p>Hello everyone! I have exciting news for everyone. Instead of your typical cybersecurity blog, I decided that we're going to do something fun with Python. Python is an amazing programming language and much friendlier than Java and C++. It is easy to learn and extremely fun to code with. For this week's blog, I'll be showing you the logic and the code to creating a simple number guessing game. The prompt for this game is simple and I'll explain the objective of the code now. </p>
<p>The objective is to create a program which will require the user to input any number within the range beween 0 to 1000. The program will then guess the number the user inputs by using the built-in random function/method and records how many times it takes to guess the user's number correctly. After, the program will then prompt the user to guess how many times it took to guess the user's number. The user has 10 chances to guess it correctly. Once the user guesses the number correctly within the 10 attempts, it will then ask the user if he or she would like to play again.</p>
<p>It sounds easy when you actually think about it in your head, but for beginners it might be a woozy to come up with the logic to code this program. But no fear! I'll be going over my code and logic about how to tackle this prompt and show you how easily it can be to complete this task. So, let's begin!</p>

<h2><b>The Code</b></h2>

<p>When it comes to coding, we need to think about the logic to code a program piece by piece. First things first, we need to establish a do while loop because we know we're going to prompt the user if he or she would like to play again if the user wins. Because python does not support a do while loop, I made a makeshift do while by setting the playagain variable to true so it'll run the while loop at least once. Also, I sent the count to 0 to reset the value of variable everytime the user wants to replay the game. Inside the do while loop, the program will prompt the user for an input. The program accepts the user input as a string. Because we can't compare strings to numbers since they're two different things, I used a python method to turn the user input into a integer. From there, I need to check whether the user inputs a valid number in the range from 0 to 1000. If the user fails to input a number that is valid in the range from 0 to 1000, it will rerun the program again.</p>

<p>In this section of the code, its main purpose is for the computer to guess the numer of what the user typed into the program and keep track each time it compares its number to the user's number. THe program will break out of the while loop when it finally finds the user's number. To maintain logicitivity of this code, I set a range in which the program can guess a number from which is from 0 to 1000.</p>

<p>In this piece of the code, we will need to keep track of the number of attempts the user has to guess how many times the computer had to guess to get the user's number. We start off the with the for-loop with a range at 10 exclusively. This will give the user 10 attempts starting from 0 to 9. As per usual, it will prompt the user for an input and we will need to change that input from a string to an integer to do a proper comparison. We're going to use nested if statements. We need an if statement to check if the user guesses the number correctly. If the condition satisfies, I will need to prompt the user to see if he or she would like to play again. This is where my nested if statement comes in. My nested if statement will check if the user pressed the letter "y" or any other character. If the user decides to press y, it will rerun the program; thus, resetting all the values. If the user presses any other character, the program will end. Now we're not done yet, in the outer if statement we need to include an else statement. This is to check whether the user's number is higher or lower than the program's number of attempts. It will then let the user know that his or her guess is too high or low and display the remaining attemps. I started the remaining attempts at 9 for two reasons. Logically after the first attempt, you will have 9 attempts, not 10. Also, from 9 to 0 is 10 attempts total. For some reason, I ran into errors when I was trying to print integers concatenated with strings so I had to turn the integers into strings and back into integers after I display the number of remaining attempts. From lines 52-55, the code may seem a bit weird, but its actually not. Because the for-loop I implemented in this code only increments after it checks if its within the range, I can implement an if statement outside of the for-loop to check whether the user used up all of his or her attempts. This if statement would not run prematurely because I covered all other possible means of escape when exiting the for-loop. In other words, I ensure that the if statement starting at line 52 will only run when the user runs out of attempts.</p>
