<h1><b>Linked List</b></h1>

<h2><b>Introduction</b></h2>
<p>Hello everyone, I hope all of you are having a great week so far. Based from last week's blog, I decided that it would be in everyone's best interest if I discuss more about coding. Therefore, for today's blog I'll be going over data structures; to be specific, I am going to discuss about Linked List. Keep in mind that knowing what is a Linked List and how to code a Link List are two COMPLETELY different  things. As one may know what a Linked List is, he or she will not necessary know how to code one as coding it requires knowledge of how to code via their favorite object-oriented language. Knowing how to code a Linked List will not only require the user to know what it does, but also how to intialize and create objects, along with their properities. Because of these reasons, I am going to split this segment/topic into two parts. The first part, which is this blog, will be knowing the properties and characteristics of a linked list while the second part, most likely next week's blog, I'll be discussing about how to create such objects and their properities, and an explanation of the logic of the code. With that said, let's begin!
</p>

<h2><b>What is a Linked List?</b></h2>

<p>The purpose of a linked list is to store data in an orderly manner. If you have any experience with an array, knowing how a linked list works should be fairly easy. To keep it short, an array is a fixed size chunk of memory which then is divided into n number of sections or elements where you can store and access the data. In the picture below, you can see a stand array with a length total length of 10 (we count the beginning element or section of the array starting from 0). Overall, each element of the array are next to each other in memory. Therefore, you don't actually need to do much to access each element of the array</p>

<p>In the picture above, this is how a standard linked would look like. Unlike the array, a linked list has no linear ordering in memory. A linked list uses a data structure called a node to store data. These nodes are not stored next to each other in memory, but contain data of the address and points to the next node in the linked list. The node that is at the beginning of the linked list is called a head. The head does not contain any content or data, but it points to the next node. The last node of the linked list is define when the node does not point towards another node, but points to a null reference, meaning the end of the linked list. To access a specific node in the linked list, we would have to traverse through all the node to the destination node. So why should we use a linked list instead of an array? Well, as I stated before, a linked list is dynamic while an array is fixed. If we have items that we need to store and those are items are constantly increasing or decreasing, an array will not be able to handle that kind of task. If there are too many items to store into the array, it will overflow and we would have to declare a new array to adjust accordingly. If there are far too few items to store into the array, we would be just wasting memory. For linked list, insertions and deletions of the nodes are quick in real time. It will accomodate large quantities of items by appending or prepending nodes to the list as well as deleting nodes and redirecting them to the next node.
</p>

<h2><b>Types of Linked List</b></h2>
<p>As shown below, there are two types of linked list. We have the singly linked list and the doubly linked list. The singly linked list is basically your standard linked list that I have already gone over. The doubly linked list almost follows the same characteristics of a singly linked list except it can traverse both ways instead of only one way. In terms of memory usage, the program would have to allocate more memory to the doubly linked list because each node stores two addresses that points to the next and previous node. The only exception would be the head as there is no predecessor.

<h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>
<p>Congratulations! You learned what is a Linked List and how it works. However, knowing and doing are two completely different things. In the next blog, I'll be going over the logic to coding the singly linked list. The code includes, but are not limited to constructing the nodes, constructing the linked list, the function to append, the function to delete, and the function prepend. Hopefully, you'll be able to understand the complexity of programming a linked list as most beginners have a difficult time trying to understand the logic to code the data structure.
