<h1>Binary Trees</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Hello Everyone! I hope everyone enjoyed last week's two part blog in which I went over the structure and characteristics of a linked list. It was a really fun experience and I hope all of you know how to code a linked list, along with its functionality. For this week's blog, I will be going over binary search trees. Unfortunately, this will be my last blog and I hope all of you enjoy reading them as I had fun typing them. Without further a do, let's learn about binary search trees.
</p>

<h2><b>Basics About Binary Trees</b></h2>

<p>Before we learn about Binary Trees, we need to learn about a Binary Tree Node. A Binary Tree Node contains information or data held within the node and may point up to two child nodes. A binary tree is a hierarchial data structure in which it must have the root node. Similiar to the concept of how the head node of the linked list would work, the root node begins the binary tree and it may point to at most two child nodes as shown above. The child node in which now is called the parent node if it points to at least one, but no more than 2 of its child nodes. Nodes that do no have child nodes and is not the root are called leaves. We use these Binary Trees to store as much information as we need in a hierarchial structure. It is probably the most effective and efficient way to retrieve, move, and retrieve data.</p>

<p>As shown above, this is a simple code of how to create a binary tree. First, we need to create the node object and we will need to set the default values for the node. Since we're just creating an individual node with no various connection to the other since we will be connecting the nodes with each other as shown in line 9-13. Before we get there, we need assign a variable called root to reference to the object. Since we are at the root, we need to intiliazed the right and left child and assign the respective data to it. It is a simple process. Similar to the next() method, we are going to use the right() and left () method to create the visualization and structure of the tree. Now, we're going to be doing something a little complicated. We are going to make the node with the data 3 a parent node by having a pointer that points towards the child node 9. To do this, we're going to use root.right.right to traverse through the tree to create the child node with the data 9. The pointer will go to the node 3 since its to the right of it and "branches off to the right" to generate node 9.
</p>

<h2><b>Properties</b></h2>
<p>Let's go over some porperties about binary trees. The first thing we will go over are levels. Levels is each hierarchial tier from the root to the leaves starting at 0. For example, the root node is level 0, its child nodes are at level 1, and the leaves are at level 2. The rest is self explanatory. We can calculate the maximum number of nodes based on the hierachial level the tree has. Let's denote the number of levels the binary tree has as "l", using the equation 2<sup>l</sup>. For example, in the picture above, the binary tree has a level of 2. Plugging it into the equation, 2<sup>2</sup> gives us 4. This solution means that at level 2 of the binary tree, the maximum number of nodes that the tree can have on that level is 4.
</p>

<p>Another property about binary trees is the height. THe height of the binary tree is determined by the largest number of edges from the root node to the leaf node. To find the height of the binary tree is basically finding the height of the root. For example, in the picture above, the height of the tree is 2. Starting from the root, from node 1 to 3 will make 1 edge. From node 3 to node 9 will make 2 edges. We can also find the height of a particular node; however, there is a golden rule. The golden rule is a leaf node will always have a height of 0. This rule will mean that a binary tree that has a single node, which is the root node, will have a height of 0. To move forward, to find the height of node 3, we will need to determine the largest number of edges from node 3 to the leaf node. In this case, the height of node 3 will be 1.
</p>

<h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>
<p>Unfortunately, like I said before, this would be my last blog post. If I had another blog post, I would probably gone over some code about how to create a binary tree and caculate some of its properties such as the height, level, and possibly traversing through the entire tree to retrieve and store information. Maybe, I'll probably do that sometime in the far future if or when I have time. Anyhow, I hope you learned something about Binary Tress today and hope that you guys will be able to do some more research about them. I personally like talking about binary trees since they're an interesting data structure with so many functionalities. With that said, I hope all of you enjoyed my blogs that I have posted for the past 9 months and hope to return soon to continue them. I appreciate all of you for reading my blogs and wish all of you the best of luck!</p>
