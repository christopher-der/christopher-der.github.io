<h1><b>Broken Authentication and Session Management and Cross Site Request Forgery</b></h1>

<h2><b>Introduction</b></h2>
<p>Hello all! I hope you are all well. To recap what I went through in last weeks' blog, I showed you how to install, configure, and use BurpSuite for your pen-testing needs. I believed the hardest part about using/installing Burpsuite is to install the certificate and configure the proxy server to have your browser connection go through BurpSuite. Aside from that, the installation for BurpSuite should be pretty simple. Anyhow for this week, we will be going over broken authentication and Session Management as well as Cross Site Request forgery. Securities vulnerabilities in authentication and session management in applications can be exploited by using Cross Site Scripting. This allows the attacker to hijack the user's session by obtaining his/her token that authenticates that the user is the rightful user to access the information. Basically, I am going to talk about how to exploit the flaws within the applications in terms of "pretending" to be the user by tricking the system. Without further a do, let's begin!
</p>

<h2><b>Broken Authentication and Session Management</b></h2>
<p>What is Broken Authentication and Session Management you ask? Well, they're normally found when it comes to anything functionality that is related to account management. There are but not limited to login information, logout notifications, account information, and account security questions. Attackers can exploit these flaws within the system/application by modifying the parameters and end up accessing the target's session which will display sensitive data to the attacker. Below I have listed the do not's when it comes to managing and storing user information into an application or website.
<ul>
<li>Do not store user credentials with low-level cryptography.</li>
<li>Do not have a poor account management in which the user credentials can be easily guessed or changed.</li>
<li>Do not design or implement an application that handles user credentials and data without HTTPs or sFTP.</li>
<li>Do not compromise the session ID by exposing it in the URL or any other obvious locations.</li>
<li>Do not have an application functionality in which the user can change the session parameters.</li>
</ul>
Of course, there are more do not's than what I have listed above, but these are the most common occurrences in which attackers can exploit and steal your session.

<h2><b>Cross Site Request Forgery</b></h2>
<p>A cross site request forgery attack is when the victim's browser unknowingly is forced to send a forged HTTP request that contains the user's session cookie to an application. For CSRF attacks to work, the victim must not realize that they are actually interacting with the application. From there, the victim sends a GET or POST request to the attacker in which the attacker can now exploit. The attacker can trick the victim into sending him/her the victim's personal data, money, or any other sensitive data. There are two types of request the attacker can get a victim to send which are POST and GET request. To make the victim send a GET request, one such example is when the attacker embeds a request into an image by using html as shown below:<br>
<code>&lt;img src=&quot;www.randomsite.com&quot;/&gt;</code><br>
To make the victim send a post request, it gets a little complicated, but it requires the attacker to create a form tag and using Javascript. Below is an example.<br>

It is a scary world out there with all these different types of CSRF attacks, but here are some ways to prevent being a victim in these scenarios. The best and common way to prevent CSRF attacks is to ensure that the request has a nonce token. A nonce token is a unique and random identifier tested by application. However, just because your request has a nounce request does not makes you invulnerable to CSRF attacks. There are additional measure to prevent CSRF attacks since attackers can also exploit not just yours, but the application's vulnerabilities if it has poor nonce management or does not actually validate the token.
